# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System for a Small Team

## 📌 Problem Statement

Small teams often need to share documents securely across departments. Email attachments are risky and hard to manage. This project replaces insecure sharing with a **secure, scalable, and cost-optimized solution using Azure Blob Storage**.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

- **Azure Blob Storage**: Each department gets its own container.
- **Azure AD RBAC**: Only authorized users/groups can access specific containers.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically archive or delete old files.
- **Beginner Friendly**: No complex networking or compute — just storage, identity, and automation.

## 🧱 File Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `provider.tf` | Defines required providers (AzureRM, AzureAD) |
| `variables.tf` | Sets location and other configurable values |
| `resourcegroup.tf` | Creates the resource group |
| `user.tf` | Creates Azure AD users |
| `adGroup.tf` | Creates AD groups and adds users |
| `storageAccount.tf` | Creates the storage account |
| `devContainer.tf` | Creates container for development team |
| `prodContainer.tf` | Creates container for production team |
| `lifecycle.tf` | Adds lifecycle rules (auto-tiering, deletion) |
| `roleAssignment.tf` | Assigns RBAC roles to teams for containers |

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🔹 1. Create a Service Principal

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "TerraformSP" --role="Owner" --scopes="/subscriptions/<sub_id>"
```

Save the output securely — you'll need the `appId`, `password`, and `tenant`.

### 🔹 2. Assign Directory Role to Admin

To manage users and groups via Terraform, assign **User Administrator** role to your SP or admin user:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <object_id_of_admin_or_sp> \
  --role "User Administrator" \
  --scope "/"
```

> 🔐 Required for `azuread_user` and `azuread_group` resources.

## 🔧 Export Azure Credentials for Terraform

Create a file named `.env.sh` (excluded via `.gitignore`) and add:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<your-app-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-client-secret>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<your-tenant-id>"
```

Then run:

```bash
source .env.sh
```

> ✅ This allows Terraform to authenticate securely using environment variables.

---

## 📦 Uploading Files to Blob Storage

After deploying the infrastructure, upload a file to the dev container:

```bash
az storage blob upload \
  --account-name f1lesh4r3 \
  --container-name devcontainer \
  --auth-mode login \
  --name devfile \
  --file C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\azure\azure_project\dev.txt
```

### ✅ Verify Upload

```bash
az storage blob list \
  --account-name f1lesh4r3 \
  --container-name devcontainer \
  --auth-mode login \
  --output table
```

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Hardcoded Storage Account Name**: Safe to make public **if public access is disabled** and RBAC is enforced.
- Avoid committing:
  - SAS tokens
  - Access keys
  - `.env.sh` or `.tfvars` with secrets
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.

---

## 💡 Real-World Value

This setup replaces Google Drive/Dropbox for internal use with:
- **Secure access control**
- **Automated cleanup**
- **Cost-efficient storage tiers**

Perfect for small teams, interns, or cloud beginners building real-world Azure skills.
